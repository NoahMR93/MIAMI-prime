This R code extracts and joins the output files from the 10x simulation strategy
You have to run the ART and HIV+ rates scripts first
Once you have the 10 folders of the Top-20 runs with all the outputs, and with the scripts' output too (ART and HIV+ rates), copy those into your PC
You have to name the directories, folders, and files in the same way as in the latest simulation, otherwise, the code won't work
I have the following directory structure:
Harvard CDM/PrEP CCo MIAMI/PreP Miami/Analisys_10x/optimal_ltc_exp4_0/results/results_MIAMI_BM_10_20_2022_EXP_XXIII_1607/
The exp_4 was the final experiment, and we used it for the main analysis
The _i takes values from 0-9, it indicates the total initial populations, for example, the _5 files come from a 1,000,005 initial population
You have to have 10 folders named, for example, "optimal_ltc_exp4_0" - "optimal_ltc_exp4_9"   
An alternative is to replace the names and directories in the code
We ran 4 models, their names are
optimal_ltc
pessimistic (later renamed as moderate and excluded from the main analysis)
more_pessimistic (later renamed as pessimistic)
no_improvement
The code extracts the ART, HIV+ rates, Population, and Infection outputs (either from the simulation results or the scripts outputs)
For the Infections, after extracting the data sets, the code deletes the last 10 lines of each data set
After opening the 20 data sets of each output (ART, HIV+ rates, Populations, and Infections), the R code joins each set of 20-data sets in one full data set
Finally, the R code export the full data sets to an Excel format
The weighted average is done in Excel
